# lstm-regression-model
An implementation of an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network for time series prediction. This project uses a simple LSTM model for regression tasks, with customizable activation functions (Sigmoid and Tanh) to predict values based on training data. It includes data loading, model training, and result visualization.
